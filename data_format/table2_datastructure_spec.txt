table 2 holds information about:
    1) which characters were detected by system and
    2) the percentage of frames they were detected in, for several buckets of frames
    3) the experiment name and datetime

    This table has higher resolution information: clips are divided into buckets of frames and 
    the percentage detection of each character in each bucket is output.
